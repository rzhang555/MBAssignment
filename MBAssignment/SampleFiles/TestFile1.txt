CLEVELAND -- After 2 1/2 weeks of torment, a historic collapse and the brink of elimination, the Tigers found their way past the Guardians at the perfect time, with the help of a former Ohio hero and a longtime Ohio nemesis. Dillon Dingler’s go-ahead home run in the sixth inning and Javier Báez’s leadoff double to ignite a four-run seventh led the Tigers out of their house of horrors with a 6-3 win on Thursday in Game 3 of their AL Wild Card Series at Progressive Field.
